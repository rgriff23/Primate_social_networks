# Primate social networks: basics of visualization and analysis

___

Just a little tutorial on visualizing and analyzing social networks in R. As examples, I use a few primate social networks from my undergraduate thesis (Griffin & Nunn 2011).

A write-up of the tutorial is available on my [website](https://rgriff23.github.io).
